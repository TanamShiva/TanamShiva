# Hi, I'm Shiva

Microsoft Certified Data Analyst (PL-300) with a strong background in business operations, performance monitoring, and stakeholder management.
Throughout my 10+ years in operations and team leadership roles, I regularly worked with performance metrics, analyzed complaint and service trends, and tracked operational KPIs to improve efficiency and customer outcomes. This exposure to data-driven decision-making led me to formally transition into analytics through structured upskilling and hands-on project execution.
Today, I specialize in using SQL, Power BI, Excel, and Python to transform business data into actionable insights that support strategic and operational decisions.
